# Cyberpunk Space Todo/Timer PWA: Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Cyberpunk Space Todo/Timer PWA is a sophisticated task management application with an immersive space-themed visualization system. It combines cutting-edge web technologies with a distinctive cyberpunk aesthetic to create a unique productivity tool.

## Core Vision

This application reimagines task management by visualizing tasks as entities in space, with their position representing time until due date. This spatial approach to time management creates an intuitive understanding of task urgency while delivering a visually stunning user experience.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Immersive Spatial Visualization** - Tasks exist in a 3D space environment, providing an intuitive sense of time and priority
2. **Cyberpunk Aesthetic** - Distinctive visual style with neon accents, futuristic elements, and atmospheric design
3. **Advanced Task Management** - Comprehensive task system with recurring tasks, subtasks, and detailed metadata
4. **Offline-First Architecture** - Full functionality without internet connection through PWA technology
5. **Performance Optimized** - Responsive design with performance settings for various device capabilities

## Target Audience

- Productivity enthusiasts looking for unique task management tools
- Users who appreciate visual approaches to time management
- Tech-savvy individuals who enjoy cyberpunk aesthetics
- People who need comprehensive task tracking with recurring capabilities

## Technical Foundation

The application is built on a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend Framework**: Vue 3 with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Mantine UI extended with custom CyberComponents
- **State Management**: Pinia with modular store design
- **Data Persistence**: IndexedDB via Dexie.js
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js for WebGL rendering
- **Animation**: Vue Motion and Rive for micro-animations

## Feature Highlights

### 1. Space Visualization Timeline

The centerpiece of the application is the space visualization that represents tasks in a 3D environment. Tasks are positioned based on their due date, with closer tasks representing more urgency. This creates an intuitive spatial understanding of time management.

Key aspects:
- Logarithmic time scaling for optimal visualization
- Visual indicators of task priority and status
- Interactive zoom and navigation
- Particle effects for task completion

### 2. Comprehensive Task Management

Beyond the visualization, the app provides robust task management capabilities:

- Detailed task properties including priority, tags, and color coding
- Recurring task system with flexible pattern options
- Subtasks with progress tracking
- Task history and audit logging
- Advanced filtering and sorting options

### 3. Customizable User Experience

The application offers extensive customization:

- Dark and light theme options with cyberpunk styling
- Performance settings for different device capabilities
- Interface scale adjustments
- Notification preferences
- Personal task defaults

## Accessibility & Performance

Accessibility is a core consideration, with:
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Reduced motion options
- High contrast design elements

Performance optimization includes:
- Code splitting for faster loading
- Virtualized lists for handling large task collections
- Web Workers for computational tasks
- Adaptive rendering based on device capabilities

## Development Approach

The application will be developed in six phases:
1. Infrastructure Setup
2. CyberComponents Library
3. Task Management System
4. Time Visualization System
5. Views Implementation
6. Polishing & Optimization

Each phase will deliver specific functionality and build upon previous work, with comprehensive documentation throughout the process.

## Future Potential

While the initial implementation is a standalone PWA, the architecture supports future expansion:

- Cloud synchronization capabilities
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- API integration with other productivity tools

This project represents a unique blend of innovative visualization, comprehensive task management, and distinctive aesthetics to create a memorable and useful productivity application.
