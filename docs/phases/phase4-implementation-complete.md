# Phase 4: Task Visualization Implementation

This phase implements the 3D spatial visualization feature for tasks, allowing users to view and interact with their tasks in a 3D space where the position and appearance of tasks are determined by their properties (due date, priority, completion status).

## Components Implemented

### SpaceRenderer (src/components/visualization/SpaceRenderer.vue)

A reusable Three.js scene component that provides:

- WebGL rendering and scene management
- Camera and lighting setup
- Performance optimization based on device capabilities
- Responsive design that adapts to container size
- Public methods for adding and removing objects from the scene

### TaskEntity (src/components/visualization/TaskEntity.vue)

Represents individual tasks as 3D objects in the scene:

- Different geometries based on task priority (octahedron, dodecahedron, etc.)
- Color coding based on priority
- Visual feedback for selection state
- Position calculation based on due date and priority
- Click and hover interactions
- Subtle animations for visual interest

### SpaceVisualization (src/components/visualization/SpaceVisualization.vue)

The main visualization component that:

- Integrates SpaceRenderer and TaskEntity components
- Manages task positioning in 3D space
- Provides time scale control to adjust the visual spread of tasks
- Shows task details when a task is selected
- Allows interaction with tasks (view details, mark complete)

### TaskVisual View (src/views/TaskVisual.vue)

A dedicated view component that:

- Provides a container for the visualization
- Ensures tasks are loaded before rendering
- Integrates with the app's routing system

## Utilities Implemented

### timeScaleUtils.ts

Utility functions for:

- Calculating task positions in 3D space based on due dates
- Adjusting cluster density to avoid overlapping tasks
- Converting between normalized time scale values and milliseconds

### webglUtils.ts

Utility functions for:

- Detecting WebGL support
- Optimizing renderer settings based on device capabilities
- Estimating performance to adapt rendering quality

## Visual Design Principles

The visualization follows these design principles:

1. **Spatial Organization**: Tasks are positioned in 3D space with:
   - Distance from center based on time to due date
   - Y-position (height) based on priority
   - Completed tasks positioned lower and further away

2. **Visual Encoding**:
   - Task priority represented by different geometric shapes
   - Color coding for priority levels
   - Size and glow effects for selected tasks
   - Transparency for completed tasks

3. **Interaction**:
   - Camera controls to orbit, pan, and zoom
   - Hover effects for task identification
   - Click selection to view and manage task details
   - Time scale slider to adjust the visualization density

## Technical Implementation Details

### Three.js Integration

- Custom Three.js integration with Vue 3 Composition API
- Memory management with proper cleanup of 3D resources
- Performance optimization using:
  - Adaptive pixel ratio
  - Geometry instancing for similar objects
  - Render quality adjustments based on device capabilities
  - Dynamic LOD (Level of Detail) based on distance

### Accessibility Considerations

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible task information
- Alternative task view available for users without WebGL support
- Color coding that works with color blindness (using shape differentiation as backup)

### Performance Optimization

- Dynamic adjustment of rendering quality based on device capabilities
- Throttled render loop to maintain frame rate
- Object pooling for task entities to reduce garbage collection
- Lazy loading of 3D assets
- Memory cleanup when component is destroyed

## User Experience Flow

1. User navigates to the "Visualize" tab
2. The 3D visualization loads, showing all active tasks and recently completed ones
3. Tasks are positioned in space based on their due dates and priorities
4. The user can:
   - Orbit the camera to view tasks from different angles
   - Adjust the time scale to spread tasks out or group them closer
   - Click on a task to view its details and options
   - Mark tasks as complete directly from the visualization

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the visualization include:

- Task grouping by category or tag with colored regions
- Timeline visualization with marker for "today"
- Visual notification effects for upcoming deadlines
- Task creation directly in the 3D space
- VR/AR support for immersive task management
- Task relationships visualized as connections between entities
