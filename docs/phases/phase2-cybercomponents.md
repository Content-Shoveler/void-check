# Phase 2: CyberComponents Library

This document outlines the implementation details for the second phase of the Cyberpunk Space Todo/Timer PWA project, focusing on creating the custom CyberComponents library.

## Implementation Plan

### Overview

The CyberComponents library will extend Mantine UI with custom cyberpunk styling, creating a unique visual language for our application. This phase will implement the core UI components needed for the application, following the design principles outlined in the styling guide.

### Components to Implement

#### Core Input Components
- CyberInput - Text input field with cyberpunk styling
- CyberCheckbox - Custom checkbox with animation
- CyberRadio - Radio button with cyberpunk styling
- CyberSelect - Select dropdown with custom styling

#### Display Components
- CyberCard - Card component with glowing borders
- CyberBadge - Status badge for task states
- CyberTooltip - Information tooltip with futuristic styling
- CyberProgressBar - Progress indicator with cyber styling

#### Interactive Components
- CyberButton - Custom button with hover effects
- CyberToggle - Toggle switch with sliding neon effect
- CyberSlider - Slider for time scale visualization

#### Layout Components
- CyberModal - Base modal with blur backdrop
- AppHeader - Application header with navigation
- AppFooter - Application footer
- PageTransition - Animated route transitions

### Implementation Approach

Each component will be implemented following these guidelines:

1. **Component Structure**
   - Each component will have its own directory
   - Directory will include the Vue component, tests, and documentation
   - Components will use TypeScript for prop definitions

2. **Styling Approach**
   - Leverage the existing SCSS mixins and variables
   - Follow the cyberpunk design language from the styling guide
   - Implement seamless dark/light theme switching

3. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive components
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Support screen readers
   - Implement focus states that are visible but on-theme

4. **Animation**
   - Use Vue Motion for smooth transitions
   - Support reduced motion preferences
   - Optimize animations for performance
