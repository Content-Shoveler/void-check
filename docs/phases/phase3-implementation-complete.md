# Phase 3: Data Persistence Implementation

This phase implements the persistent data storage and task management functionality for the Cyber Todo application using the IndexedDB database via Dexie.js.

## üîã Database Layer

### Database Service
- Implemented `database.ts` service using Dexie.js to provide IndexedDB access
- Created schema with proper indexes for efficient querying
- Implemented database initialization logic

### Task Repository
- Created `taskRepository.ts` as a data access layer between the store and database
- Implemented CRUD operations for tasks
- Added specialized query methods (getOverdueTasks, getTasksDueToday, etc.)
- Implemented subtask management
- Added tag management functionality

## üîÑ State Management

### Tasks Store Update
- Refactored the tasks store to use the repository instead of localStorage
- Implemented async methods to interact with the database
- Added error handling for database operations
- Implemented filtering, sorting, and searching functionality
- Added computed properties for different task views (all, active, completed, today, etc.)

## üß© UI Components

### Task List Components
- Created `TaskList.vue` to display tasks in categorized sections:
  - Overdue tasks
  - Today's tasks
  - Upcoming tasks
  - Completed tasks
- Implemented TaskListItem.vue for individual task display with:
  - Completion toggle
  - Visual priority indicators
  - Due date formatting
  - Subtask progress visualization
  - Tag display
  - Edit and delete actions

### Task Modal
- Implemented `TaskModal.vue` for task creation and editing with:
  - Form validation
  - Date and time picker
  - Priority selection
  - Tag management (add/remove)
  - Subtask management (add/remove/toggle)
  - Recurring task options
  - Notification settings

### Tasks View
- Updated the Tasks view to integrate all components
- Implemented filtering and sorting controls
- Added search functionality
- Created responsive layout with proper spacing and alignments

## üí™ Features

### Task Management
- Complete CRUD operations for tasks
- Subtask support with completion tracking
- Priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Due dates with visual indicators for overdue items
- Tags for categorization
- Notes field for additional information

### Filtering & Sorting
- Filter by status (all, active, completed)
- Filter by due date (today, overdue)
- Sort by various fields (due date, creation date, priority, title)
- Text search across task titles and descriptions

### User Experience
- Smooth animations for list transitions
- Visual feedback for task completion
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Consistent styling with the cyberpunk theme

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- Used TypeScript interfaces for strong typing
- Implemented proper error handling throughout
- Used computed properties for derived data
- Leveraged Vue's reactivity system for real-time updates
- Added descriptive comments for maintainability
