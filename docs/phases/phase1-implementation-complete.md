## Technical Details

### Store Modules

1. **Settings Store**
   - Handles theme preferences (dark/light/system)
   - Manages application visual settings
   - Persists user preferences to localStorage
   - Implements theme switching with smooth transitions

2. **UI Store**
   - Manages modal states

   - Handles responsive layout adjustments
   - Maintains view preferences (list/card views)

3. **Tasks Store**
   - Manages task data with full CRUD operations
   - Implements filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Handles recurring tasks and subtasks
   - Persists data to IndexedDB

### Routing System

- Implemented with Vue Router
- Configured for lazy loading of route components
- Updates document title based on current route
- Maintains scroll position between route changes

### Styling System

- Created a robust SCSS architecture:
  - Variables for consistent theming
  - Mixins for reusable styling patterns
  - Utility classes for common styling needs
- Implemented responsive design utilities
- Set up cyberpunk-specific visual effects:
  - Neon glow effects
  - Glassmorphism effects
  - Glitch animations

### PWA Configuration

- Set up service worker with workbox
- Configured web app manifest
- Implemented offline capabilities
- Added PWA installation support

## Testing Results

The initial infrastructure build is successful, with:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Clean build output
- ✅ Proper component structure
- ✅ Functioning routing system
- ✅ Working state management

## Next Phase: CyberComponents Library

The foundation is now in place to begin Phase 2, which will focus on developing the CyberComponents library by extending Mantine UI with our custom cyberpunk styling.

### Components to Implement in Phase 2

- Core Input Components (CyberInput, CyberCheckbox, CyberRadio, CyberSelect)
- Display Components (CyberCard, CyberBadge, CyberTooltip, CyberProgressBar)
- Interactive Components (CyberButton, CyberToggle, CyberSlider) 
- Layout Components (CyberModal, AppHeader, AppFooter, PageTransition)

Each component will follow the cyberpunk design language established in the theming guide, with appropriate animations and accessibility features.
